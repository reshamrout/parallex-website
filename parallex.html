        </div>
        <p class="text">
          The most famous cycling race is the Tour de France. The Tour de France
          started in 1903. As cycling races became popular, different formats
          for racing were developed. These races involved individuals or teams,
          and they are contested in different ways. The races can be a one-day
          race, criterium, and time trail to multi-stage events. In time trial
          races, it requires the participants to ride against the clock. As well
          as road racing, there are many cycling events held on a banked track
          called a velodrome, usually indoors. The riders can participate
          individually or in teams. Organizations for cycling have strict rules
          on the bicycles that are used in the races.

          <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Paragliding, sport of flying parachutes with design modifications that
          enhance their gliding capabilities. Unlike hang gliders, their close
          relations, paragliders have no rigid framework; the parachute canopy
          acts as a wing and is constructed of fabric cells with openings at the
          front that allow them to be inflated by movement through the air—the
          “ram-air” effect. The pilot is suspended in a seated harness and
          controls the wing via lines attached to the trailing edge of the
          paraglider. These lines may be operated individually to turn the
          paraglider or simultaneously to influence pitch and speed. Takeoff and
          landing are on foot and usually occur on a hill or mountain. To
          launch, the pilot first inflates the wing by pulling it up like a kite
          and then runs down the hillside until flying speed has been reached.
          Usually a speed of about 12 miles per hour (19 km per hour) is enough
          to launch the craft. Paragliders may also be launched from flatland by
          towing, either with a winch or behind a vehicle.

          <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or
          two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section,
          or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer
          towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on
          ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open
          ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave
          pools. The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a
          board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards.
          The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native
          peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such
          water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees,
          while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a
          surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to
          as stand-up surfing.
